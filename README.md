# regkeyPropertySwitch
switches the registry key property names

Colleague of mine ran into an issue where he had to rename certain properties in a registry key's names that started with a "1_" to "2_".  
The properties that started with a "2_" had to be renamed to "1_".

I wrote out this simple script to help him.
